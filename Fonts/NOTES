Here are the steps transcribed:

Add your custom font files into your project using XCode as a resource
Add a key to your info.plist file called UIAppFonts.
Make this key an array
For each font you have, enter the full name of your font file (including the extension) as items to the UIAppFonts array
Save info.plist
Now in your application you can simply call [UIFont fontWithName:@"CustomFontName" size:12] to get the custom font to use with your UILabels and UITextViews, etcâ€¦
